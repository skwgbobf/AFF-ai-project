"# AFF-ai-project

This is the `AFF-ai-project`, aimed at developing AI models for predicting the onset of Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter (AFF) using advanced techniques like BEHRT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers for Electronic Health Records) and BERTopic for multimorbidity pattern identification.

## Features
- **AFF Prediction**: Utilizes deep learning techniques to predict AFF onset based on five-year pre-onset disease history.
- **Multimorbidity Analysis**: BERTopic is used to analyze and visualize disease patterns, identifying comorbidities associated with AFF across different populations.
- **Gender-Specific Disease Patterns**: Identifies cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurodegenerative disease patterns in male and female patients with AFF.
